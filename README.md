Eris
=====

### Opus #19

A library for interacting with the Discord API at a very low level.

### Description

Eris provides simple access to the Discord API without smothering data in layers of needless, slow wrappers. \
It also avoids forcing users into particular design choices (futures, lambdas.)

The library is designed to be:
1. Simple, so that a beginner can use it.
2. Non-restrictive, so that users are not forced to use it in a certain way.
3. Modifiable, so that users can access it at any level.
4. Small, so that users do not need to shade megabytes of needless third-party libraries.
